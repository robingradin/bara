\usage{
check_batch(batch, ref, n_samples, force = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{batch}{Character/Numeric/Factor. The vector should represent
the batch belongings for the samples in the test set x. If a vector is
supplied, each batch is independently adjusted. Therefore, each batch
must contain at least 1 reference sample.}

\item{ref}{Numeric vector, index of the reference samples in the test set.}

\item{n_samples}{Numeric, number of samples in x.}

\item{force}{Logical, should errors associated to the identification of 
batches without reference samples be suppressed? Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
Character vector.
